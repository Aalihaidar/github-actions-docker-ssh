# In this case, it runs on pushes to the 'main' branch.

    # Step 2: Load the SSH Private Key from GitHub Secrets
    # This action configures the ssh-agent with your private key, allowing secure SSH connections.

    # Step 3: Run Docker command on the remote server
    # This step uses SSH to connect to your remote server and run the docker command.
